# TODO

Requires Changes
4 specifications require changes

Project Deliverables
Student includes a README to explain how to test their code.

:x: Test instructions are not included in the README

Suggestion
Include a test section like this

How to run the tests:

\*\*truffle test

or

\*\*npm test

Student provides Contract Addresses, Contract Abi's, OpenSea MarketPlace Storefront link's.

The readme should include two different contract addresses, like this:

Verifier : 0xABCETC...
SquareVerifier : 0xABCETC…
OpenSea Marketplace : https://marketplace.opensea.io/tokens/0xABCETC…

OpenSea Marketplace
Student list ERC721/ ZoKrates tokens & complete transactions on market place

:x: The OpenSea MarketPlace Storefront link is missing from the README or is not pointing at a marketplace store, please correct this issue to pass this rubric item

Deployment
Student deploys ERC721 contracts with Zokrates integration.
